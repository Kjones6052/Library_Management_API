API Documentation

Be clear and concise - ensure the documentation is easy to read and understand. Use simple language, avoid jargon, and include examples.

Provide detailed examples - include practical examples for each endpoint and data format to demonstrate how to use the API.

Keep it up to date - make sure your documentation reflects the latest version of the API and remains accurate.

Organize it well - structure the documentation logically, with clear sections and a table of contents for easy navigation.

Offer support and feedback - if you're going to publish an API provide ways for developers to ask questions and give feedback. This can be as easy as pinning a 
support email to the top of the documentation.

Be mindful of indentations - everything should line up accordingly
check out indent-rainbow in extensions marketplace

Recycle format, change details, rinse and repeat

Pluralization - paths, tags, parameters, responses, etc

TDD => Test Driven Development

write the tests before writing the code 

helps improve code quality, speeds up development, and reduces bugs

TDD Cycle = Red - Green - Refactor
Red = write a test that fails, testing for functionality means the test should fail due to no implemented functionality
Greed = write the simplest code that passes the test, discard any code that doesn't serve the purpose
Refactor = improve the code, make it cleaner, more readable, and more efficient

Unit Testing = test individual components in isolation to handle bugs
 - the results of tests and the state of the application should not change the results of the test
 
when refactoring code consider error handling, use try/except blocks to handle any potential errors

adding try/except blocks will handle potential errors more gracefully but may add to run time

------------

using the testing config allows us to apply tests to our code without changing our existing data

using sqlite database is good for testing creation and manipulation of data

when testing a route consisting of only the url-prefix, must use a trailing "/" for instance "/members/"

if 'python -m unittest discover tests' doesn't run the tests try 'python -m unittest discover -s app/tests'
